#Heart Disease Prediction

The following research and coding was done by **[Ankit Kapoor]("https://github.com/ankitkapooor")**, **[Tauqir Waqar Panvelkar]("https://github.com/tauqirwaqar")**, and **[Justin Sunil David]("https://github.com/justinjsd")**

The research paper explores the idea of predicting heart disease based on a person’s medical data using various machine learning algorithms. Through the course of the paper, we explore various characteristics necessary to the process of predicting heart disease. The paper compares multiple machine learning algorithms (naïve bayes, K-nearest neighbors, XGBoost, decision trees, random forests, and linear regression) and ranks them on the basis of their accuracy, the f1 score and area under the ROC curve. By assessing all these factors, we aim to conclude which algorithm among the ones selected is the best for prediction of heart diseases. The dataset used in this paper has been taken from the UCI machine learning repository.
